1) Cats and Dogs classification

  Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats

I have used Tensorflow , Keras , Sequential to make this model 
also i have used generators and normalization to train my model batch wise 
then after creating the model i have plot the train and validation plot to 
vizualize the model accuracy
